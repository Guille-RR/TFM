This repository contains the code for my master's degree thesis project: Detection of Entanglement using Variational Quantum Circuits. It includes the Jupyter Notebook with the plots of the presented resuls in the thesis and the code for estimating the geometric entanglement measures and sharp geometric entanglement measure.
